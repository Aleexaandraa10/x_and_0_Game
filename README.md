# ❌⭕ X and 0 Game (MinMax & Alpha-Beta AI)

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game in Python using **PyGame** for the graphical interface and **AI algorithms** (MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning) for the computer opponent.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms used

- **MinMax**: recursively simulates all possible game outcomes to choose the best move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: optimized version of MinMax that ignores unnecessary branches, making the AI faster.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python x_si_0.py
